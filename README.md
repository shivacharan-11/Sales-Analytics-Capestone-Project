Project Conclusions (Power BI + EDA)
•	Customer Distribution & Behavior
o	EDA revealed that most customers are located in North America and Western Europe, with the USA and Germany leading in customer count and sales.
o	Power BI visualizations showed that repeat customers contribute over 70% of total revenue, indicating strong customer retention.
o	Acquisition trends show steady customer growth with occasional spikes, especially around certain time periods (e.g., holiday seasons).
•	Sales Performance Insights
o	Sales heatmaps and trend lines in Power BI identified Q3 as the peak sales period, likely driven by seasonality.
o	EDA highlighted a positive correlation between order frequency and total sales per customer segment.
o	Sales performance dashboards revealed that top 3 sales representatives contribute to over 40% of company sales.
•	Employee and Regional Analysis
o	EDA showed that employees handling fewer orders still maintain high revenue per order, suggesting a potential for mentoring or best-practice sharing.
o	Regional breakdowns in Power BI maps highlighted underperforming areas that could benefit from focused sales efforts or promotions.
•	Product and Inventory Trends
o	EDA helped detect low-performing products with high stock levels, indicating excess inventory and potential deadstock.
o	Power BI inventory dashboards showed that some high-demand products frequently go out of stock, affecting sales opportunities.
o	Product category analysis revealed that "Beverages" and "Condiments" consistently rank highest in revenue generation.
•	Supplier and Shipping Insights
o	Supplier performance metrics in Power BI showed that a few suppliers consistently deliver on time, while others have higher delays and variability.
o	EDA uncovered patterns of late shipments affecting high-value orders, suggesting the need for better supplier contracts or backups.
•	Strategic Recommendations
o	Use targeted marketing to convert one-time customers into repeat buyers.
o	Optimize inventory using predictive analytics to reduce overstock and prevent stockouts.
o	Focus on underperforming regions and employees with training, incentives, or support to improve overall performance.
