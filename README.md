Project Conclusions (Power BI + EDA)
Customer Distribution & Behavior
EDA revealed that most customers are located in North America and Western Europe, with the USA and Germany leading in customer count and sales.
Power BI visualizations showed that repeat customers contribute over 70% of total revenue, indicating strong customer retention.
Acquisition trends show steady customer growth with occasional spikes, especially around certain time periods (e.g., holiday seasons).
Sales Performance Insights
Sales heatmaps and trend lines in Power BI identified Q3 as the peak sales period, likely driven by seasonality.
EDA highlighted a positive correlation between order frequency and total sales per customer segment.
Sales performance dashboards revealed that top 3 sales representatives contribute to over 40% of company sales.
Employee and Regional Analysis
EDA showed that employees handling fewer orders still maintain high revenue per order, suggesting a potential for mentoring or best-practice sharing.
Regional breakdowns in Power BI maps highlighted underperforming areas that could benefit from focused sales efforts or promotions.
Product and Inventory Trends
EDA helped detect low-performing products with high stock levels, indicating excess inventory and potential deadstock.
Power BI inventory dashboards showed that some high-demand products frequently go out of stock, affecting sales opportunities.
Product category analysis revealed that "Beverages" and "Condiments" consistently rank highest in revenue generation.
Supplier and Shipping Insights
Supplier performance metrics in Power BI showed that a few suppliers consistently deliver on time, while others have higher delays and variability.
EDA uncovered patterns of late shipments affecting high-value orders, suggesting the need for better supplier contracts or backups.
Strategic Recommendations
Use targeted marketing to convert one-time customers into repeat buyers.
Optimize inventory using predictive analytics to reduce overstock and prevent stockouts.
Focus on underperforming regions and employees with training, incentives, or support to improve overall performance.
Strengthen relationships with reliable suppliers and reevaluate contracts with those causing frequent delays.
